Welcome to my page!

I am Zhenghang Xu (徐正航), a fourth-year PhD candidate in [Operations Management and Statistics](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/faculty-and-research/academic-areas/operations-management-and-statistics/) at [Rotman School of Management](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/), University of Toronto. It is my great honor and pleasure to be advised by Prof. [Philipp Afeche](https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/15099-philipp-afeche), Prof. [Opher Baron](https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/10004-opher-baron), Prof. [Dmitry Krass](https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/7243-dmitry-krass), Prof. [Arik Senderovich](https://profiles.laps.yorku.ca/profiles/sariks/), and Prof. [Mark van der Laan](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/mark-van-der-laan). Prior to my PhD, I received my bachelor's degree in Statistical Science from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) in 2021.

I develop data-driven frameworks that combine causal inference, machine learning, and operations management to support decision-making in complex service systems. My recent work introduces causal models for queueing systems that uncover system dynamics directly from data, enabling counterfactual analysis without relying on restrictive analytical assumptions. I also study Bayesian pricing strategies that adaptively learn customer valuations and optimize revenue under operational constraints.

I am one of the current cohosts for the [Rotman Young Scholar Seminar series](https://sites.google.com/view/rotmanyoungscholarseminar/home). If you are interested in joining the seminar series, feel free to contact me!
